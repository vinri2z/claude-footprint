# Methodology

## Overview

Emissions are estimated from token counts using per-token factors derived from peer-reviewed research. The approach is intentionally simple: one number per model family per token direction. No real-time data, no per-request tracing.

The paper measures inference energy consumption on AWS infrastructure for a range of models, then converts to CO2e using grid-average carbon intensity.

## Formula

```
session_co2_grams = (
    (input_tokens + cache_write_tokens) * input_factor
  + cache_read_tokens * (input_factor * cache_read_factor)
  + output_tokens * output_factor
) / 1_000_000
```

Factors are in gCO2e per million tokens. `cache_write_tokens` (`cache_creation_input_tokens`) are a full prefill, so they count at the input factor. `cache_read_tokens` count at a reduced `cache_read_factor` (default 0.08) of the input factor (see Cache read energy below).

## Infrastructure parameters

| Parameter | Value            | Description                                      |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| PUE       | 1.14             | AWS datacenter power usage effectiveness         |
| CIF       | 0.287 kgCO2e/kWh | Carbon intensity factor (US grid average)        |
| WUE       | 0.18 L/kWh       | Onsite water usage effectiveness (used in water calc) |
| EWIF      | 3.14 L/kWh       | Offsite electricity-generation water intensity (used in water calc) |

## Per-model factors (gCO2e per million tokens)

| Model family | Input | Output | Source                     |
| ------------ | ----- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| Fable        | 1000  | 6000   | Extrapolated (2x Opus)     |
| Opus         | 500   | 3000   | Extrapolated (3x Sonnet)   |
| Sonnet       | 190   | 1140   | Measured (Jegham et al.)   |
| Haiku        | 95    | 570    | Extrapolated (0.5x Sonnet) |

## Why input and output factors differ

Output tokens are ~6x more expensive than input tokens in terms of compute. During prefill (input processing), the model processes all input tokens in parallel. During decoding (output generation), each token requires a full forward pass through the model sequentially. This autoregressive step dominates energy consumption.

## Why Fable, Opus and Haiku are extrapolated

The Jegham paper measured Sonnet-class models directly. The other families are estimated by scaling:

- Fable = 2x Opus (no published measurement for Fable 5 / Mythos 5; the list-price ratio, $10/$50 vs $5/$25, is used as a compute proxy)
- Opus = 3x Sonnet (larger model, roughly proportional parameter count)
- Haiku = 0.5x Sonnet (smaller model, lighter compute)

These are order-of-magnitude estimates. Actual values depend on Anthropic's specific hardware configuration and batching strategies, which are not publicly available.

## Water footprint

Water is estimated from the same inference energy as CO2, using a water-intensity factor in place of the carbon-intensity factor. Both are `energy × intensity`, so per token the two are proportional:

```
session_water_liters = (
    (input_tokens + cache_write_tokens) * water_input_factor
  + cache_read_tokens * (water_input_factor * cache_read_factor)
  + output_tokens * water_output_factor
) / 1_000_000
```

Water factors are in liters per million tokens. The same `cache_read_factor` (0.08) applies, because water tracks energy.

### Water intensity (WIF)

Total water intensity is the sum of two components:

| Component | Value      | What it covers                                                        |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onsite (WUE)  | 0.18 L/kWh | Water evaporated by datacenter cooling (AWS 2024 reported ~0.15, rounded up) |
| Offsite (EWIF)| 3.14 L/kWh | Water consumed generating the electricity (US-grid average)           |
| **Total (WIF)** | **3.32 L/kWh** | Onsite + offsite                                                  |

Per-model water factors are derived from the CO2 factors: `water_factor = co2_factor × WIF / CIF = co2_factor × 3.32 / 287 ≈ co2_factor × 0.0115679 L/gCO2e`.

| Model family | Input (L/Mtok) | Output (L/Mtok) |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Fable        | 11.568         | 69.408          |
| Opus         | 5.784          | 34.704          |
| Sonnet       | 2.198          | 13.187          |
| Haiku        | 1.099          | 6.594           |

### Why this is a conservative (over-estimated) figure

The offsite EWIF uses the **US-grid average** (3.14 L/kWh, Reig et al./WRI), not the more water-efficient mix of the specific AWS regions Anthropic runs in. Applying both the onsite WUE and the offsite EWIF to the full facility-level energy (which already includes PUE) over-applies the onsite term slightly. Both choices push the estimate up on purpose: the headline water number is meant to be an upper bound, not a best guess.

## Excluded models (non-Anthropic)

Claude Code can be pointed at non-Anthropic models (e.g. local models behind `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`). Their impact profile is not an AWS datacenter's, so neither the emission factors nor the API pricing apply. Sessions whose dominant model string does not contain `claude` (including the `<synthetic>` marker) are stored with their raw token counts but `cost_usd = 0`, `co2_grams = 0` and `excluded = 1`, and are left out of all report aggregates. Additional models can be excluded by name via the `exclude_models` patterns in `data/factors.json`. Because raw tokens are preserved, excluded sessions can be re-priced later by `recompute.sh` if factors for local models are ever added.

## Token counting and deduplication

Token counts come from parsing the JSONL transcripts (`message.usage`). Assistant messages are deduplicated by `(message.id, requestId)`, keeping the last occurrence, before summing. This matters because resumed and compacted sessions replay earlier messages within the same file, and streaming writes the same message multiple times with a growing `output_tokens`. Without dedup the raw line sum over-counts by roughly 3x (on observed data, 55% of assistant lines are replays). This matches the deduplication ccusage performs.

## Surviving the 30-day transcript purge

Claude Code purges JSONL transcripts after about 30 days, so the SQLite DB is the only durable record. Two design choices follow:

1. **Capture before purge.** The `Stop` hook (`persist-session.sh`) writes each session to the DB when it ends, while the JSONL still exists. A throttled `SessionStart` hook (`safety-rescan.sh`) re-runs `backfill.sh` once a day in the background to catch any session the `Stop` hook missed (crash, kill, hook disabled), as long as its transcript is still within the 30-day window. The only unavoidable gaps are history older than the install date and downtime longer than 30 days.

2. **Store raw tokens, derive on demand.** Each row stores the raw token breakdown: `input_tokens` (regular input + cache write), `cache_creation_tokens` (cache write), `cache_read_tokens`, and `output_tokens`. Cost and CO2 are pure functions of these counts plus `data/factors.json` and `data/prices.json`, so they can be regenerated at any time with `recompute.sh` without re-reading the (purged) JSONL. When Anthropic changes a price, or a factor is revised, edit the config and run `recompute.sh`. Rows are tagged `methodology_version`; only version >= 2 carries the full raw-token breakdown, so older rows captured before this change are left untouched as legacy.

`recompute.sh` recomputes a mixed-model session (subagents on a different model) at the row's dominant model, a small approximation; the original insert is model-accurate per subagent.

## Cache read energy

A `cache_read` token is a previously-processed context token whose key/value tensors are reused, so its prefill compute is skipped. It is not free in energy: during decode, every generated token re-reads the entire KV cache from HBM, including the cached tokens (GreenCache, SIGMETRICS: "caching does not reduce computation in the decode phase"). So the energy of a cached token is the decode-phase KV-read residual that survives caching.

No study directly measures the cache_read-to-input energy ratio. The default `cache_read_factor` of **0.08** (defensible range 0.05-0.15, hard bound 0-0.20) is an engineering estimate derived from adjacent measurements: prefill is ≤ 3.4% of total inference energy for generation workloads (Solovyeva & Castor), a larger KV cache amplifies per-token decode energy by 1.3-51.8%, and per-token energy rises ~3x from 2K to 10K context (TokenPowerBench, H100). The factor is workload-dependent and grows with context length; a flat constant understates very long reused prefixes.

This factor is **not** Anthropic's 0.1x cache_read billing ratio. That is a price, not an energy measurement (OpenAI prices the same mechanism at 0.5x). Setting `cache_read_factor` to 0 is a defensible lower bound but treats a reused 100K-token system prompt as carbon-free, which understates a real memory-bandwidth cost.

## Cost estimate

The `cost_usd` column is the theoretical API list value of the usage (what it would cost on pay-as-you-go), not the subscription price actually paid. It uses current Anthropic list pricing per million tokens: Opus 4.6+ at $5 input / $25 output (not the retired $15/$75 of Opus 4.0/4.1), Sonnet at $3/$15, Haiku at $1/$5. Cache write is billed at 1.25x input and cache read at 0.1x input. On deduplicated data this reconciles to within a few percent of ccusage.

## Limitations

- Order of magnitude only. Do not use these numbers for regulatory reporting or lifecycle assessments.
- Inference only. Training costs and hardware manufacturing are not included. Cooling water (onsite) and electricity-generation water (offsite) ARE included in the water estimate, at order-of-magnitude accuracy.
- Cache read energy is a derived estimate, not a measurement (see Cache read energy below). Cache reads are 90%+ of tokens in Claude Code, so the chosen factor (default 0.08) is the single biggest lever on the headline number.
- Status line is approximate. Claude Code does not expose `cache_read_input_tokens` separately in the statusline hook JSON, and parsing JSONL incrementally at each turn would be too slow. The live display uses `context_window.total_input_tokens` (current context size, includes cache reads, no subagents). This is not used in reports.
- Grid-average, not real-time. The CIF is a static US grid average. Actual emissions depend on Anthropic's datacenter location, energy mix, and time of day.
- No multi-region awareness. AWS runs inference in multiple regions with different grid intensities.
